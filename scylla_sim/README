Testing area for MegaBEAST development

beast_sim directory has two subdirs
   both use a scylla field with 3 band photometry
   scylla_sim is a beast run for all ages and one metallicity
      and a range of dust from 0 to 2.5 A(V)
   scylla_sim_single is a best run for a single age and one metallicity
      and very low dust

both megabeast settings files use the results run with
   beast_sim/scylla_sim_single/sim_max.fits as the observed data
